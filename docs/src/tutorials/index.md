# Tutorials

## Installation

```bash
pip install element-electrode-localization
```

+ See the [User Instructions page](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/user-guide/) to 
install the integrated development environment and database.

+ These instructions use the example
[workflow for Element Array Ephys](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-array-ephys),
which can be modified for a user's specific experimental requirements. This example
workflow uses several Elements (Lab, Animal, Session, Event, Electrophysiology, and
Electrode Localization) to construct a complete pipeline, and is able to store
experimental data and run data analysis.

## Notebooks

The [Electrode Localization notebook](./08-electrode-localization.ipynb) is part of a
larger [tutorial series](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/element-array-ephys/latest/tutorials/)
on Element Array Ephys. To run this notebook, be sure to
[download the data](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/element-array-ephys/latest/tutorials/00-data-download-optional/)
and [configure your settings](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/element-array-ephys/latest/tutorials/01-configure/).
